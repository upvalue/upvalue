ðŸŒŠ Hi there! 

I'm Phil, a software developer currently on sabbatical. ðŸ¤™ 

You can check out my website [at upvalue.io](https://upvalue.io).

Currently I'm working on two projects:

### [=> tekne](https://tekne.app)

- a freestyle productivity app in the shape of an outline editor
- [demo](https://demo.tekne.app)
- [devlog](https://upvalue.io/posts/tag/tekne). [Most recent article: Just put the whole backend in the frontend](https://upvalue.io/posts/just-put-the-backend-in-the-frontend)

### [=> otium](https://github.com/upvalue/otium)

a modern retro computer inspired by lisp machines, mechanical keyboards and just having fun. Just getting started.

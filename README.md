ðŸŒŠ Hi there! 

I'm Phil, a software developer currently on sabbatical. ðŸ¤™ 

You can check out my website [at upvalue.io](https://upvalue.io).

Currently I'm working on two projects:

### [=> tekne](https://github.com/upvalue/tekne) 

- a freestyle productivity app in the shape of an outline editor
- [demo](https://demo.tekne.app)

### [=> otium](https://github.com/upvalue/otium)

a dynamic programming environment inspired by smalltalk and lisp machines.
